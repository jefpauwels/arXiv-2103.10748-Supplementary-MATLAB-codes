This package allows for SDP relaxations of

		- informationally restricted correlations
		- dimension restricted on average
		- energy restricted correlations

It works for both classical and quantum cases. 
The level can be tuned arbitrarily. 
Symmetries can be incorporated, but it is a bit inconvenient. 
It normalises away the final projector in each measurement.
