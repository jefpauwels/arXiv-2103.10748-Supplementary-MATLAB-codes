This folder contains several annotated seesaw codes used to obtain results in arXiv:2103.10748 [quant-ph]. All of them are annotated and should be easy to use.

For **entanglement-assisted classical communication**:

 - `Seesaw_EACC.m` (for Gallego and RAC witnesses). 
 - `Seesaw_EACC_tritRAC.m` (for the trit-based RAC).

For **quantum communication**:

 - `GeneralSimpleBinaryOutcomeSeesawNOSDP.m`: This code is written as a matlab function. The required function arguments can be found as annotations in the function file.

**For entanglement-assisted quantum communication**:

 - `GeneralSimpleBinaryOutcomeSeesawENTSDP.m`: This code is written as a Matlab function. The required function arguments can be found as annotations in the function file.

For **information-bounded quantum communication**:

 - `Seesaw_Information.m`

In addition, we have uploaded the optimal strategies reported in arXiv:2103.10748 [quant-ph] in separate subfolders as .mat files.
